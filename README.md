# library

library is a web app that lets you create, display, and manage a collection of books. You can add new books with their title, author, number of pages, and read status. You can also change the read status, edit the book details, or remove the book from the library. The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## How to use

To use library, simply download project open the `index.html` file in your browser. You will see a table with your current library and a button to add a new book. You can click on the button to open a form where you can enter the book details and submit it. The book will be added to the library and displayed on the table.

You can also interact with the books on the table by clicking on the buttons on each row. You can click on the Read button to toggle the read status of the book. You can click on the Edit button to open a form where you can modify the book details and save them. You can click on the Remove button to delete the book from the library.

## How it works

library uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses pure JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and handle the logic of the app. It uses classes to create book objects with properties and methods.
